# IMDb-Reviews-Analytics-ETL

## Project Objective:
Create a modular ETL pipeline that:
1. Extracts raw IMDb-related data from multiple CSVs (movies, ratings, users, etc.)
2. Transforms and merges them into clean, analytics-ready tables
3. Loads the final datasets into a Microsoft SQL Server database
